A short position in trading is when a trader sells an asset they donâ€™t own, betting that its price will decline so they can buy it back cheaper later, 
profiting from the difference. This is also called short selling.
How it works:
The trader borrows the asset (e.g., stocks, crypto) from a broker.
They sell it at the current market price.
If the price drops, they buy it back at the lower price, return the asset to the broker, and keep the profit (minus fees/interest).
If the price rises, they face a loss when buying back at a higher price.
Key Points:
Goal: Profit from a falling market or asset price.
Risk: Potentially unlimited losses if the price keeps rising, unlike buying (long positions) where losses are capped at the investment.
Timeframe: Can be short-term (minutes to days) or longer, depending on the strategy.
Common in: Stocks, forex, futures, options, and crypto markets.
Example:
You short 100 shares of a stock at $50 ($5,000 total).
The price drops to $40. You buy back at $4,000, profiting $1,000 (minus fees).
If the price rises to $60, buying back costs $6,000, losing $1,000.
Short positions require careful risk management due to high risk and margin requirements.


Trend line acts as support in uptrend and resistance in downtrend. At breakout point trend changes , so strategise accordingly
